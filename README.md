# LeetSpeak


LeetSpeak is a small project I wrote as a part of a tutorial I made on WinSock2.

The project is meant to be a demonstration on socket communication and nothing more.

LeetSpeak is fully text-based and runs inside a console window.

It's only capable of one-on-one communication at this time.

# Disclaimer


I seriously advice against using outside of education as the project is incredibly insecure without any form of encryption.

Meaning all of your conversations would be open to the public eye.
